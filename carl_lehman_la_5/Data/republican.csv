It does not stop there. She responded to it.


From Julia,
&gt; Hi Stephen. I do not personally manage my website. I explained in my statement yesterday that a staffer who wrote the language in one platform page (written in first-person) mistakenly said this. I asked that it be corrected as soon as I was alerted to it yesterday morning.

https://twitter.com/JuliaCarmel__/status/1033376472529031168



The problem is there is a video of her saying she is an immigrant.

Agriculture Commissioner Republican candidate Matt Caldwell has the NRA endorsement.
( Agriculture commission handles concealed carry permits in Florida)
What about the candidates for Judge?
It’s non partisan, so they can’t say which party they belong to. I would just vote for Republicans as I think they would generally be tougher on crime, more pro life and more gun friendly.
I have Group 13, 18 and 25 on my ballot. I have been to ALL their websites and they all have the same words about skills, justice and fairness.
Even the scientist candidate says she has skills, while her rival is a public defender. 
It’s like it is secret information whether they even belong to a political party. 
I’ve searched the net and there is no one issuing recommendations for judge candidates. I see Tea party recommendations for Texas, but none in Florida.

Hello fellow Republicans! I am a Republican who loves debate. However, if you look at rule 1, debate is not allowed. I am not complaining about this, as debate would encourage trolling from your opposition all over this sub. However, if any of you guys are interested in debating your beliefs with people who have opposing viewpoints in an environment where everyone is required to be respectful, please consider partaking in discussions on my new [subreddit](https://new.reddit.com/r/Debatocratics/). If you wish to gather a group of like-minded people within your community before heading over, please feel free to do so.

If you hate debate, and it gives you a headache, you don't have to come. However, I firmly believe that healthy debate is necessary for democracy to function, and by debating with your peers you make the world a much better place.",Place for Debate [Friendly Advertisement],1

&gt;I’ve been so inspired by the #WalkAway campaign that I'm getting over my fear and adding my voice. It’s such a shame what’s happening to our country. I’ve seen this quote in several places recently and it resonates with me enough to try and paraphrase it here: if your love for your country hinges on who is president, then you don’t love your country. I am so proud to be an American and have the right to sit here today and express these thoughts. I’ve tried to voice my concerns but it feels like such an all or nothing argument coming from the left. To vocalize any kind of dissenting opinion that doesn't fall in lock/step with “the war for social justice” gets us labeled a nazi, bigot, or some other kind of racist— sometimes by our own families. So here's my contribution to this movement. From one lifelong Democrat, here to say No More. I’m nowhere near Conservative, nowhere near Republican, but I’m still breaking up with my party. No more rabid cognitive dissonance, no more exaltation of victimhood-- I’ve chosen to #WalkAway. - Vanessa Berben

t3_8z8s0t,"On November 6, 2018, Americans will go to the polls to choose their representatives in government.  Many of those elections will be for national-level seats in the US House and US Senate.

Many voters will take advantage of early voting to avoid the crowds at the polls.

In the two or three weeks before election day, we will witness a time-honored American tradition: the October surprise.

Our various Intelligence Agencies have stated that the Russians are going to try to influence the 2018 election.  This shouldn't be a shock to us - they (and their predecessor, the Soviet Union) have been meddling in US politics for the better part of a century.

Its just a lot easier now between social media and the near-complete control by the left of broadcast media, and the President who told our cybersecurity folks to stand down when he was told in 2016 that the Russians were meddling in the election wasn't a Republican.

Fortunately we've been assured over and over again by our Intelligence Agencies that the Russians' efforts in 2016 failed, and that they weren't able to change any votes.  Their influence operations were largely conducted *after* the election, to sow dissent.

It is not in the Russians' interest for the US Congress to have a large Republican Majority, especially not if it is in both chambers.

As such, keep these things in mind when the inevitable October Surprises begin to roll in against Republican candidates:

1. The entire point of an October Surprise is to get you to react emotionally to information about which the whole story is not known.  The in-depth reporting that might exonerate a candidate (especially a Republican involved in an election) might not come out for weeks or months.  The MSM would rather report the politically-convenient lie than the politically-inconvenient truth.

2. It has been demonstrated that 40 year old accusations that can't be proven make effective ""October Surprise"" material, with willing and enthusiastic participation by the leftist press.  Expect more of this.  They know it works.",Something to think about ahead of the November elections,1

Carol Swains presentation on the PragerU YouTube channel is extremely informative, but I know there has to be more information on why people think this way.

I live in California, so it's no surprise that I'm surrounded by Liberals everywhere and especially at my University.

Was hoping someone can tell me why the left thinks this way. Something more descriptive than, ""because they're dumb."" It would be pretty helpful! :) ","""Republicans changed in the 1950s, they are the real racists."" - My Liberal Friends",1

t3_9bqr6n,"Hello, I am relatively new to Reddit.
I've been looking for a possibility to debate someone from the left side of the isle on internet, mostly because I acknowledge my weak understanding of politics and desire to change the situation.
I found few people, and I pm them. Some of them were open to share their views but very soon shut themselves up after my contr-arguments.

Every time I write about politics somewhere I get downvoted very hard, presumably by bots, but also by lefties.
But they never want to have a civil debate - get very offensive sometimes.

If you recommend me to find one in real life, then - where? 

But I want to use reddit avatar for right now, just to get more experience and make sure I understand politics well enough to not be afraid to open my mouth in public.
