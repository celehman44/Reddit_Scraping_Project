The following is just some reflections I have been working on from the Devils advocate position of the Iraq war being necessary.
I know youll hate me for it, but Im curious as to your opinion


It is almost common consensus that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a mistake at best, and at worst, the worst foreign policy decision in recent years. However, coming to either conclusion one would have to overlook facts and circumstances that led up to the invasion itself. The undisputed facts about Saddam Hussein and the time period between the two gulf wars would indicate that a second war with Iraq was only a matter of time. The current situation with North Korea and the Trump administration helps illustrate the potential danger of letting rogue states slowly grow in power and influence. Saddam’s regime was in some ways more dangerous and unpredictable than North Koreas. By the time of the Iraq invasion, it had started a brutal war with Iran, used chemical weapons on its own people, invaded and occupied Kuwait and launched missiles into Saudi Arabia and Israel. During the 1990s, Iraq was constantly visited by United Nations Weapons Inspectors, seeking to investigate and stop Iraq’s suspected development of Weapons of Mass destruction activity.  Iraq ceased cooperation with the inspectors in 1998, and UN inspections would not resume until 2002.

President Bill Clinton acknowledged the threat Iraq posed,  when he signed into law the Iraq National Liberation act of 1998. With nearly universal support of the U.S Congress the Act made leant official US support to helping democratic opposition groups replace Saddam’s government, citing Saddam’s potential Weapons of mass Destruction capabilities as  as only one of many justifications for the act which included:

1.	The Iraq instigated 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war, which resulted in nearly 2 million casualties, including chemical attacks on the Kurds, an ethnic group native to Northern Iraq
2.	Iraq’s violation of terms of the 1991 Gulf War Ceasefire, (which  included moving troops to the border of Kuwait in 1994 and attempting to invade and control the autonomous Kurdish region in the North)
3.	The attempted assassination by car bomb of  the Emir of Kuwait and former President George H.W Bush in 1993. 

All of these undisputed facts led to a bi partisan consensus that Saddam’s regime was a potential security threat that had to be addressed. 

Although the Saddam Hussein regime had no role 9/11 attacks and was not officially allied with Al-Qaeda it was a supporter of terrorism in the region and around the world, and paid host to several terrorists including.

1.	Abu Nidal, Palestinian terrorist (top of FBI’s most wanted  list before Osama Bin Laden.

2.	Muhammad Abbas (of the 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking)

3.	Abdul Rahman Yasin who mixed chemicals for first 1993 WTC attacks.

4.	In addition to inviduals Saddam helped finance the 2000-2001 Palestinian Intifadah against Israel, awarding cash rewards  (of up to x amount of dollars)  to the families of the deceased. 


In conclusion, Saddam Hussein’s regime was uniquely brutal and troublesome on a level unmatched by most of the United States adversaries, including Iran. With it’s history of terrorism, WMD development, and unprovoked war,…..(will finish conclusion.)

I am the Labour Party prospective candidate for the Thames Valley in the Model House of Commons.

/r/MHOC is a Model House of Commons based in reddit. It's election time, and the model Labour Party desperately needs your votes!

You can vote here, it only takes a minute:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/46xtgq/general_election_v_megathread/

You vote using the New Reddit Based System, which means you are no longer required to comment to verify your vote. It uses D'Hondt, so you need only cast one vote for Labour in your chosen constituency! We're standing everywhere, but we've also got Labour-Cooperative candidates in the Hampshire, Greater Manchester, English Borders, Wales and Birmingham.

Not only is it important for the game that we have a strong Labour party (so we can escape the harsh realities of the Tory government in real life!), but it would mean a lot to all of us involved as we've put a lot of work into this campaign and the subreddit. We're a mix of people from across Labour's internal political spectrum, many of whom are members in real life, and our brief manifesto can be found here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOCPress/comments/46wuu2/gev_labour_party_manifesto/

It only takes a minute, but, as I said, it would mean a great amount to us and we would all be eternally grateful. If you want to join the model party, please do - you'll find a link in the /r/MHOC sidebar - and we'll very happily welcome you to our subreddit (/r/MHOCLabour). 

Cheers!

836,"High income earner, why should I or should I not vote for Bernie?Hi all, so I am looking for some advice on Bernie Sanders. I am very liberal when it comes to social policies, but somewhat down the middle on fiscal policies. Mainly because I earn a lot of money. I live in California, so I won't even get to choose whether it's Hillary or burning. But I am just asking in a meta type of way. I earn about 300 a year, all of it from salary. So I guess the question is, Is it against my best interest to vote for Bernie, seeing as how he is a socialist and would be redistributing wealth. Or does that really only go to the people that are making all of their money from reinvesting previous wealth?  So, as a high income earner, why should I and why should I not vote for Bernie, considering I do agree with his social liberalism."
669,"Come and Join the Model DemocratsMy fellow Democrats,

I’m /u/randomKdebater, a member of the Democratic party on /r/ModelUSGov. I’m here today to convince you to join the Model Democratic party, institute the laws you have always wanted to see be instituted, debate, and connect with a great community. 

The Model Democrats have already made some great legislative progress, such as repealing the Taft-Hartley Act, increasing the minimum wage to $15, creating a negative income tax, increasing funding for education and infrastructure. The Democrats have also spearheaded almost all environmental and green legislation, championed issues of women’s rights, minorities, legalized gay marriage, and have stood for net neutrality. However, this isn’t enough, because there is still so much left to do. 

The Model Democrats are also a great space; everyone is incredibly friendly, and excited to help out new members get accustomed to the simulation. In the community, you can debate and express your opinion, receive help from more experienced members, and try your hand at creating pieces of legislation. The Democrats also have fun weekly movie nights, questions of the week, and so much more!

Midterm elections are coming up, and the Republican party has been on the rise, doing very well in state elections and turning more and more into its real life counterpart. Not to mention, the rise of a new Nationalist/Fascist party only reinforces that these types of laws are not safe from being overturned without your help.

Whatever Party you do decide to join, we'd be glad to have you in the sim, and I hope you have a great time there as well. We would be incredibly grateful to have you join our sub and have a fantastic, and very realistic experience of government in one of the best communities on the sim!
Here is the link to join: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/525kz7/join_a_party/

867,"Hello fellow AmericansHello everybody. Hope you all had a good Columbus Day weekend. I am starting a thread on this Reddit today to extend an olive branch across the aisle. I am a Republican. But I wholeheartedly respect the viewpoints of those on the left. To be honest, America would not be as great as it is without such a difference of opinion. Everyone thinking the same would be something more you would expect out of a country like North Korea. And so I welcome your differences in thought. First I will tell you what this thread is not. I have not come here looking to try to force Republican talking points upon independents/democrats. I have come here to remind everyone that we are all Americans who all live side by side in this great country. Some of my neighbors are Democrats, some of my Coworkers are Democrats even some of my immediate family are Democrats but most importantly they are all Americans.
I honestly believe that most Americans (Republicans and Democrats) are good people and want nothing but the best for all Americans with their policy ideals. And by good people I also mean that the vast majority of Americans are not racists, are not sexists, bigots, sociopaths. And that statement being true for the vast majority of Americans supersedes party lines. Yes, that even includes Republicans. At this time in history the left has almost a complete monopoly of the media and to that I congratulate you. But I don't think this majority of media should be used to label half of our population as racists/sexist/bigots. Just because people do not agree with Obama does not mean they are racist. Just because people support the deportation of all immigrants whom are here illegally does not mean they are racists or bigots. Just because Christians think about abortions (I should mention I am actually pro-choice) are murder does not mean they hate women. And finally, just because some Democrats support Bernie Sanders does not make them communists. Can we all join together as Americans now and stand up to both sides of the media and loudly proclaim ""No I will not succumb to these tactics, I will not participate in mudslinging fellow Americans. I will not rush to judgement on quotes taken out of context and I will not automatically assume someone is racist/sexist/bigot just because they disagree with me""?
I believe that most Americans believe that the success of the civil rights movement and 19th amendment are just as responsible for making this country great as the very founding of our constitution. This is 2015, it is time for us to stop the animosity that so divides us from joining together as Americans. Because united is  undoubtedly the strongest form we have.

""You liberals just don't get it do you?

So first off, It is the democrats that do not care about the poor or lower middle class. The Democrats want these people on food stamps, welfare, and other subsidies because it is a way to control them. The Dem's use these payouts as chains and they have put this class of people into a new type of slavery. If you like being a slave vote for the Democrat way. High taxes cause business to hold back paying the people or they just move out. The keystone pipeline is GOOD for the environment unless you like it being transported on trucks that LEAK all over the place and are environmentally unfriendly. The child care issue you speak about Congress failed on that one not Trump. Over regulation KILLS business and innovation. This video has so many inaccuracies it is obvious it was not thought out and the whole picture was not looked at. Just look at CUBA- that organization was killing its people and abusing them. The Cuban people are suffering why on earth would we support that? Look at what Cuba was doing to our diplomats. You better open your eyes and start looking at the whole picture since it is obvious you have been brain washed and you believe the main stream media and not thinking about whats best for the US. Even your Isreal comments about Jerusalem Congress under Obama voted FOR the move and it has been suggested for 15 years but Trump finally said Do it.﻿"""

The use of hispanic as a general term to group every person that speaks Spanish is asinine. What is currently defined as hispanic, includes people from all races whose only common trait in most cases is that they speak Spanish. They dont eat the same food, listen the same music or share a common history. A Mexican and a Cuban are as miles apart culturally. Even a Mexican and a Salvadorian which share a more similar background can barely stand each other. 

We need conservatives and they are already here. Break this made up nonsensical group instituted by democrats (mostly made to identify poor mexican migrants) and welcome them into the fold. "

If the trend of anti culture appropriation continues, I believe future cultural developments would stop. Also as someone who loves cultures, I like to participate in a lot of them. My room is Chinese themed, I like a lot of foreign music, I like making foreign dishes and have traditional shirts from other countries and I'll be damned if someone accuses me of culture appropriation for enjoying what the world has to offer "

With Rand Paul I understand that he plans on cutting Federal Income Tax down to 15% for everyone. Which would mean less of my money would go to government etc.

With Bernie I understand that he will try to take money from the rich and give to the poor; like a robin hood character.

What I'm wondering is would I be one of those receiving aid or one of those whom he plans to take wealth from. (I don't plan on being a billionaire; I'm essentially just an average middle class student who plans on staying in the middle class).

I plan on majoring in finance when I go to university and I'm also wondering if Sanders attack on banks would hurt a finance major because I'd assume banks would be less enticed to hire entry-level financial analyst with less capital.
