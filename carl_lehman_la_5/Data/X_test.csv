Regarding legalization of marijuana, I haven’t heard much regarding republican views. To me, it sound like a win-win situation. State  makes money off its taxes, ilegal sell decreases, no more people who  are incarcerated for possession of it   have to spend unnecessary time in prison which means that tax payers’ money can be redirected to amore useful causes. Plus is less deadly than alcohol and tabaco which are both legal. I want to see (glance) at what a general republican opinion looks like. Whether you support it or not or are undecided.

I am very liberal when it comes to social policies, but somewhat down the middle on fiscal policies. Mainly because I earn a lot of money. I live in California, so I won't even get to choose whether it's Hillary or burning. But I am just asking in a meta type of way. I earn about 300 a year, all of it from salary. So I guess the question is, Is it against my best interest to vote for Bernie, seeing as how he is a socialist and would be redistributing wealth. Or does that really only go to the people that are making all of their money from reinvesting previous wealth?  So, as a high income earner, why should I and why should I not vote for Bernie, considering I do agree with his social liberalism."

Might I interest you in Reddit’s own Model US Government? In /r/ModelUSGov, we have an active Federal government with a House of Representatives, Senate, President, Supreme Court, as well as an active state government encompassing six states (all six are made up of the US's real states) each with a governor, assembly, and court system. In Model US Gov we have many members who propose bills, debate, run for office, and interact with a large community of individuals.

We would like you, a member of a movement dedicated to fighting far-right extremism, bigotry, racism, and hatred to help us do the same within our small community. The Democrats have uniquely passed legislation in order to better the lives of Americans by passing a $15 Minimum Wage, Universal Healthcare, gun-control legislation, criminal justice reform and the elimination of private prisons, environmental legislation, and much more. However, there’s still more to do, and we need your help to prevent the growing alt-right and anarcho-capitlaists from overturning much of the progress we’ve achieved. 

If you would like to join a great community, and participate in a fun and fairly accurate simulation of government politics, be sure to join us on this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/5ymhfb/join_a_party/) and ask to join the Democrats. 

Thanks, and we hope to see you there!"

If the trend of anti culture appropriation continues, I believe future cultural developments would stop. Also as someone who loves cultures, I like to participate in a lot of them. My room is Chinese themed, I like a lot of foreign music, I like making foreign dishes and have traditional shirts from other countries and I'll be damned if someone accuses me of culture appropriation for enjoying what the world has to offer "

What is currently defined as hispanic, includes people from all races whose only common trait in most cases is that they speak Spanish. They dont eat the same food, listen the same music or share a common history. A Mexican and a Cuban are as miles apart culturally. Even a Mexican and a Salvadorian which share a more similar background can barely stand each other.
