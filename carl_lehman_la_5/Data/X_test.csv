669,"Come and Join the Model DemocratsMy fellow Democrats,

I’m /u/randomKdebater, a member of the Democratic party on /r/ModelUSGov. I’m here today to convince you to join the Model Democratic party, institute the laws you have always wanted to see be instituted, debate, and connect with a great community. 

The Model Democrats have already made some great legislative progress, such as repealing the Taft-Hartley Act, increasing the minimum wage to $15, creating a negative income tax, increasing funding for education and infrastructure. The Democrats have also spearheaded almost all environmental and green legislation, championed issues of women’s rights, minorities, legalized gay marriage, and have stood for net neutrality. However, this isn’t enough, because there is still so much left to do. 

The Model Democrats are also a great space; everyone is incredibly friendly, and excited to help out new members get accustomed to the simulation. In the community, you can debate and express your opinion, receive help from more experienced members, and try your hand at creating pieces of legislation. The Democrats also have fun weekly movie nights, questions of the week, and so much more!

Midterm elections are coming up, and the Republican party has been on the rise, doing very well in state elections and turning more and more into its real life counterpart. Not to mention, the rise of a new Nationalist/Fascist party only reinforces that these types of laws are not safe from being overturned without your help.

Whatever Party you do decide to join, we'd be glad to have you in the sim, and I hope you have a great time there as well. We would be incredibly grateful to have you join our sub and have a fantastic, and very realistic experience of government in one of the best communities on the sim!
Here is the link to join: https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/525kz7/join_a_party/

I am very liberal when it comes to social policies, but somewhat down the middle on fiscal policies. Mainly because I earn a lot of money. I live in California, so I won't even get to choose whether it's Hillary or burning. But I am just asking in a meta type of way. I earn about 300 a year, all of it from salary. So I guess the question is, Is it against my best interest to vote for Bernie, seeing as how he is a socialist and would be redistributing wealth. Or does that really only go to the people that are making all of their money from reinvesting previous wealth?  So, as a high income earner, why should I and why should I not vote for Bernie, considering I do agree with his social liberalism."

So first off, It is the democrats that do not care about the poor or lower middle class. The Democrats want these people on food stamps, welfare, and other subsidies because it is a way to control them. The Dem's use these payouts as chains and they have put this class of people into a new type of slavery. If you like being a slave vote for the Democrat way. High taxes cause business to hold back paying the people or they just move out. The keystone pipeline is GOOD for the environment unless you like it being transported on trucks that LEAK all over the place and are environmentally unfriendly. The child care issue you speak about Congress failed on that one not Trump. Over regulation KILLS business and innovation. This video has so many inaccuracies it is obvious it was not thought out and the whole picture was not looked at. Just look at CUBA- that organization was killing its people and abusing them. The Cuban people are suffering why on earth would we support that? Look at what Cuba was doing to our diplomats. You better open your eyes and start looking at the whole picture since it is obvious you have been brain washed and you believe the main stream media and not thinking about whats best for the US. Even your Isreal comments about Jerusalem Congress under Obama voted FOR the move and it has been suggested for 15 years but Trump finally said Do it.﻿"""

I believe electoral reform is inevitable. If you help to educate the public, it will accelerate the process and the people will respect you for it. I have been talking with people on the streets and most people will support electoral reform: the issue is education.

Without your help, it will be much slower going. But the process has already begun, and continues to gain momentum. Thanks for reading."

If the trend of anti culture appropriation continues, I believe future cultural developments would stop. Also as someone who loves cultures, I like to participate in a lot of them.

He is refusing to acknowledge that conservatives are reasonable people, and he is trying to promote Liberal bias in Wikipedia because he is saying that all Conservative news sources are ""Fake News."" Instead of ignoring this guy, or rejecting him, I have been talking with him.  Its been quite a conversation, and I'm not going to stop. The only way this will end is if he gives up, or we come to an agreement.

Take a look guys!

824,"Vote Labour (Democrats) in the Model House of Commons General Election!Greetings!

I am the Labour Party prospective candidate for the Thames Valley in the Model House of Commons.

/r/MHOC is a Model House of Commons based in reddit. It's election time, and the model Labour Party desperately needs your votes!

You can vote here, it only takes a minute:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/46xtgq/general_election_v_megathread/

You vote using the New Reddit Based System, which means you are no longer required to comment to verify your vote. It uses D'Hondt, so you need only cast one vote for Labour in your chosen constituency! We're standing everywhere, but we've also got Labour-Cooperative candidates in the Hampshire, Greater Manchester, English Borders, Wales and Birmingham.

Not only is it important for the game that we have a strong Labour party (so we can escape the harsh realities of the Tory government in real life!), but it would mean a lot to all of us involved as we've put a lot of work into this campaign and the subreddit. We're a mix of people from across Labour's internal political spectrum, many of whom are members in real life, and our brief manifesto can be found here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOCPress/comments/46wuu2/gev_labour_party_manifesto/

It only takes a minute, but, as I said, it would mean a great amount to us and we would all be eternally grateful. If you want to join the model party, please do - you'll find a link in the /r/MHOC sidebar - and we'll very happily welcome you to our subreddit (/r/MHOCLabour). 

Cheers!
