580,"What's going on with the property tax? Is it a community tax or an investment tax?The property tax is a community tax. The community pays tax on property into school budgets and City Council general funds. Property tax is a community tax.

If property can/is an investment. And increased property values is the purpose. The property tax can be used as an investment tax, not a community tax.

If Citizen A lives in an apartment an his neighborhood's property tax increased 25% in 4 years. Citizen A's purchasing power has decreased.

If Citizen B buys and remodels a home next to an apartment complex. Over 4 years his property taxes have increased 25%. Citizen B's home value has increased 65%. Citizen B has increased their portfolio.

If Citizen B sells stock and puts it in their savings account. Citizen B is assessed stock sale/investment tax at year end.

If Citizen A takes $200 from pay check and deposits it in savings while standing at the window next to citizen B. Citizen A is not assessed stock sale tax.

If property is an investment and property is not an investment. And the City Council/County Government can raise property values as part of their duties. City can have a happy, wealthy, person and a larger budget if they raise property values. Then property is not a proper investment. It is fraudulent.

Then, the County/City can raise property values to help reassess their citizens portfolio. Which also helps their budget. Property is an investment. Property is a portfolio.

The City/County raise property values to help/reassess their citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A community renter can not afford to stay, and moves. Which helps the citizen's portfolio. Which helps the city's budget.

The City/County raise property values to help/reassess their citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A community renter can not afford to stay, and moves. Which helps the citizen's portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A 30 year homeowner is on a fixed income and can not afford to stay. Homeowner sells house. House is turned into high end duplex. Which helps the citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget.

The City/County raise property values to help/reassess their citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A community renter can not afford to stay, and moves. Which helps the citizen's portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A 30 year homeowner is on a fixed income and can not afford to stay. Homeowner sells house. House is turned into high end duplex. Which helps the citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. 20 renters and 9 homeowners can't afford to stay and movie. Properties are town down and luxury apartments are build. Which helps the citizen's portfolio. Which helps the city's budget.

Property is an investment. Property is not an investment. Property tax pays for school and budget and city general fund. Property tax is a community tax, so what happened to the community?

Citizen A has a well funded investment account. Politician A can raise/lower dollar amount on Citizen A's investment account. Politician A tells citizen A that he can raise investment account 15% every year. Which will help his budget. If Citizen A agrees, Politician A will lower % from 4% to 3.5% in 2 years, 3.5% to 3% in 4 years, 3% to 2.5% in 6 years, and 2.5% to 2% in 8 years.

That's fraud.

If property is an investment.

City/county benefit from return on investment

If property is a portfolio

City/County do assess worth of portfolio

If property value reflects on City/County budget

City/Count will increase portfolio's value

If property value is increased by high value structure

City/County duty is to approve structures. Structures will always be approved

If property is an investment. But, the property tax is a community tax. Then City/County are required to exercise prudence. IF the property tax has been used to enrich investors and defraud the community. The city/county have acted illegally.

If property is an investment and the city/county have improperly applied a community tax as an investment tax. Exponentially rising costs will eventually remove the community. If, the city/county duty's include – property value assessment – and approval of new construction. And their community is only investors. Then it is not a community, it is a portfolio. And if the community is a portfolio. Then the City/County are not a government, they are investment managers. If investment community can force/coerce/vote added value to their portfolio. It is a criminal operation.

If Sky-scrappers and mega-structures add value. And a large American city has had a demographic shift and growth over 12 years. And the City/County has been using the property tax as an investment tax. Cost of living will go through the roof. If the City/County requests state/federal aid or funding for section 8 housing to house what were formerly housed citizens. Then that is a racket.

If the City/county – in the face of this – approve a new high value structure to increase ROI for community investors. The city/county is openly acting against the non-investor. If this is to continue – then the progressive/mega-city growth will continue – as the community-as-an-investment's children will have to always move to settle.

If property is an investment and property is not an investment. And the investor has minimal effect in overall quality of life of the investor. But the investor can drastically effect the quality of life and world of the non-investor. And the investor has a choice of living arraignments and the non-investor does not. Then the community needs to be planned around the non-investor.

The property tax is not an investment tax. The property tax is a community tax. If property is taxed, not because it is property, but because of its physical location within a community. Then the overall reason for owning property, investment or non-investment, should not be taken into consideration when applying the tax. If it has? If two decades of defrauding the community to enrich investors – causing untold damage to the American Public – resulted in any personal wealth or kickbacks to the City/County then they need to be held accountable. If a government refuses to hold themselves accountable. Then surrounding communities, cities, and counties, effected need to sue to force a cessation of mega-projects until all infrastructure upgrades have been planned for and completed and all necessary arrangements for displaced members of the community have been met.

Hello fellow Republicans! I am a Republican who loves debate. However, if you look at rule 1, debate is not allowed.

Plus is less deadly than alcohol and tabaco which are both legal. I want to see (glance) at what a general republican opinion looks like. Whether you support it or not or are undecided.

The enraging and dystopian phenomenon that is Donald Trump combines the scapegoating and quest for national glory of the late Wiemar Republic, the perverted scandal and egotism of the Julio-Claudians, and so much sheer idiocy that he is well on his way to founding a leading world religion -- based, of course, on himself. &lt;drops mic&gt;"

621,"Support the Model Democrats against the GOP and Libertarians!Hello fellow Democrats Supporters,

Might I interest you in Reddit’s own Model US Government? In /r/ModelUSGov, we have an active Federal government with a House of Representatives, Senate, President, Supreme Court, as well as an active state government encompassing six states (all six are made up of the US's real states) each with a governor, assembly, and court system. In Model US Gov we have many members who propose bills, debate, run for office, and interact with a large community of individuals.

We are currently in the middle of a Federal Election, and the Democrats are facing a tough reelection from Republicans and Libertarians. The Republicans have fielded a presidential candidate who very much resembles Donald Trump in his rhetoric and policy stances. Candidate /u/Viktard has been shown to be vehemently against abortion, universal healthcare, and has been proven to be a puppet for the extremists in his own party. On top of their presidential candidate, the GOP have also provided the alt-right an avenue to take down our Democracy. This is the time for people like you to join in the fight against the right! The Democrats are currently working with the Socialists, who have supported very moderate Incumbent /u/Bigg-Boss for reelection to the Presidency.

If you would like to help our cause, here’s how, and it will only take a few seconds:

1. Follow this link: https://musgov.melect.net/login

2. Follow all the directions. If you are asked to chose which state in which to vote, you are free to chose any irl state. The Democrats are running in The West, The East, the Northeast, and Central States. The map can be found [here](http://i.imgur.com/hnvHrVc.png) of where the irl states are corresponding to our in-sim states.  


3. Vote for the /u/Bigg-Boss(Socialist)/ /u/Aoimushi (Green-Left) presidential ticket, and vote for Democrats down the ballot (if no democrats are in the state you pick, choose our allies the Socialists or Green-Leftists).

Thank you for your help, and may Democracy stand strong against those who seek to destroy it.

&gt;I’ve been so inspired by the #WalkAway campaign that I'm getting over my fear and adding my voice. It’s such a shame what’s happening to our country. I’ve seen this quote in several places recently and it resonates with me enough to try and paraphrase it here: if your love for your country hinges on who is president, then you don’t love your country. I am so proud to be an American and have the right to sit here today and express these thoughts. I’ve tried to voice my concerns but it feels like such an all or nothing argument coming from the left. To vocalize any kind of dissenting opinion that doesn't fall in lock/step with “the war for social justice” gets us labeled a nazi, bigot, or some other kind of racist— sometimes by our own families. So here's my contribution to this movement. From one lifelong Democrat, here to say No More. I’m nowhere near Conservative, nowhere near Republican, but I’m still breaking up with my party. No more rabid cognitive dissonance, no more exaltation of victimhood-- I’ve chosen to #WalkAway. - Vanessa Berben

Democrats have gone out of their way to say that the Russians attempted to influence our election by the hacking of the DNC and Podesta. But they have never spoken to the veracity of the information that was leaked, detailing corruption and collusion throughout the DNC. Why is it more important to say that Russian interference was a bigger deal, than talking about and confronting the corruption that was highlighted in the emails? Does it not matter that the people running the party are doing everything they can to lie to their party members in order to keep power? Please I want to understand this."

The Senate has unconstitutionally refused to work with him to appoint a new supreme court justice. Therefore he must take unilateral action. Its a long shot, but he does pay attention to the official White House petitions. Right now, its the only constructive thing I can think to do.

Full text below: 

WE THE PEOPLE ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROPOSE A NEW ADMINISTRATION POLICY: 

That the President immediately appoint a supreme Court justice 

Article II section 2 of the U.S. constitution states that the President can appoint a supreme Court justice with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Senate has explicitly refused to do its constitutional duty. It has given up the opportunity to advise and consent despite being given every opportunity and more than a reasonable amount of time to do so. Therefore, the President must take action and appoint a supreme Court justice. As the Senate has ignored its duty, the President must move forward nonetheless or else allow a defacto usurpation of executive power and an undermining of our constitution. This is the proper response to the ongoing crises created by the Senate. The questions raised by this crisis will be settled by a decision from the full nine member supreme Court."""

The following is just some reflections I have been working on from the Devils advocate position of the Iraq war being necessary.
I know youll hate me for it, but Im curious as to your opinion


It is almost common consensus that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a mistake at best, and at worst, the worst foreign policy decision in recent years. However, coming to either conclusion one would have to overlook facts and circumstances that led up to the invasion itself. The undisputed facts about Saddam Hussein and the time period between the two gulf wars would indicate that a second war with Iraq was only a matter of time. The current situation with North Korea and the Trump administration helps illustrate the potential danger of letting rogue states slowly grow in power and influence. Saddam’s regime was in some ways more dangerous and unpredictable than North Koreas. By the time of the Iraq invasion, it had started a brutal war with Iran, used chemical weapons on its own people, invaded and occupied Kuwait and launched missiles into Saudi Arabia and Israel. During the 1990s, Iraq was constantly visited by United Nations Weapons Inspectors, seeking to investigate and stop Iraq’s suspected development of Weapons of Mass destruction activity.  Iraq ceased cooperation with the inspectors in 1998, and UN inspections would not resume until 2002.

President Bill Clinton acknowledged the threat Iraq posed,  when he signed into law the Iraq National Liberation act of 1998. With nearly universal support of the U.S Congress the Act made leant official US support to helping democratic opposition groups replace Saddam’s government, citing Saddam’s potential Weapons of mass Destruction capabilities as  as only one of many justifications for the act which included:

1.	The Iraq instigated 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war, which resulted in nearly 2 million casualties, including chemical attacks on the Kurds, an ethnic group native to Northern Iraq
2.	Iraq’s violation of terms of the 1991 Gulf War Ceasefire, (which  included moving troops to the border of Kuwait in 1994 and attempting to invade and control the autonomous Kurdish region in the North)
3.	The attempted assassination by car bomb of  the Emir of Kuwait and former President George H.W Bush in 1993. 

All of these undisputed facts led to a bi partisan consensus that Saddam’s regime was a potential security threat that had to be addressed. 

Although the Saddam Hussein regime had no role 9/11 attacks and was not officially allied with Al-Qaeda it was a supporter of terrorism in the region and around the world, and paid host to several terrorists including.

1.	Abu Nidal, Palestinian terrorist (top of FBI’s most wanted  list before Osama Bin Laden.

2.	Muhammad Abbas (of the 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking)

3.	Abdul Rahman Yasin who mixed chemicals for first 1993 WTC attacks.

4.	In addition to inviduals Saddam helped finance the 2000-2001 Palestinian Intifadah against Israel, awarding cash rewards  (of up to x amount of dollars)  to the families of the deceased. 


In conclusion, Saddam Hussein’s regime was uniquely brutal and troublesome on a level unmatched by most of the United States adversaries, including Iran. With it’s history of terrorism, WMD development, and unprovoked war,…..(will finish conclusion.)

I've been looking for a possibility to debate someone from the left side of the isle on internet, mostly because I acknowledge my weak understanding of politics and desire to change the situation.
I found few people, and I pm them. Some of them were open to share their views but very soon shut themselves up after my contr-arguments.

Every time I write about politics somewhere I get downvoted very hard, presumably by bots, but also by lefties.
But they never want to have a civil debate - get very offensive sometimes.

If you recommend me to find one in real life, then - where? 

But I want to use reddit avatar for right now, just to get more experience and make sure I understand politics well enough to not be afraid to open my mouth in public.

The questionnaire should take 30-45 minutes to complete.

You will be given the online anonymous questionnaire that consists of a variety of questions. We ask that you answer each question honestly. Upon completing the questionnaire, you will be given a debriefing form with contact information for the Principal Investigator, Institutional Review Board, and several help lines.

You may refuse to answer any of the questions, take a break or stop your participation in this study at any time. This survey is completely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any point.

If you have any questions, please contact Caitlin Stone, Western Carolina University Clinical Psychology alumni, at [cheighes1@catamount.wcu.edu](mailto:cheighes1@catamount.wcu.edu) or Hannah Hinkel, Western Carolina University Clinical Psychology student, at [hhinkel1@catamount.wcu.edu](mailto:hhinkel1@catamount.wcu.edu).

The use of hispanic as a general term to group every person that speaks Spanish is asinine. What is currently defined as hispanic, includes people from all races whose only common trait in most cases is that they speak Spanish. They dont eat the same food, listen the same music or share a common history. A Mexican and a Cuban are as miles apart culturally. Even a Mexican and a Salvadorian which share a more similar background can barely stand each other. 

We need conservatives and they are already here. Break this made up nonsensical group instituted by democrats (mostly made to identify poor mexican migrants) and welcome them into the fold. "

Might I interest you in Reddit’s own Model US Government? In /r/ModelUSGov, we have an active Federal government with a House of Representatives, Senate, President, Supreme Court, as well as an active state government encompassing six states (all six are made up of the US's real states) each with a governor, assembly, and court system. In Model US Gov we have many members who propose bills, debate, run for office, and interact with a large community of individuals.

We would like you, a member of a movement dedicated to fighting far-right extremism, bigotry, racism, and hatred to help us do the same within our small community. The Democrats have uniquely passed legislation in order to better the lives of Americans by passing a $15 Minimum Wage, Universal Healthcare, gun-control legislation, criminal justice reform and the elimination of private prisons, environmental legislation, and much more. However, there’s still more to do, and we need your help to prevent the growing alt-right and anarcho-capitlaists from overturning much of the progress we’ve achieved. 

If you would like to join a great community, and participate in a fun and fairly accurate simulation of government politics, be sure to join us on this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/5ymhfb/join_a_party/) and ask to join the Democrats. 

Thanks, and we hope to see you there!"

867,"Hello fellow AmericansHello everybody. Hope you all had a good Columbus Day weekend. I am starting a thread on this Reddit today to extend an olive branch across the aisle. I am a Republican. But I wholeheartedly respect the viewpoints of those on the left. To be honest, America would not be as great as it is without such a difference of opinion. Everyone thinking the same would be something more you would expect out of a country like North Korea. And so I welcome your differences in thought. First I will tell you what this thread is not. I have not come here looking to try to force Republican talking points upon independents/democrats. I have come here to remind everyone that we are all Americans who all live side by side in this great country. Some of my neighbors are Democrats, some of my Coworkers are Democrats even some of my immediate family are Democrats but most importantly they are all Americans.
I honestly believe that most Americans (Republicans and Democrats) are good people and want nothing but the best for all Americans with their policy ideals. And by good people I also mean that the vast majority of Americans are not racists, are not sexists, bigots, sociopaths. And that statement being true for the vast majority of Americans supersedes party lines. Yes, that even includes Republicans. At this time in history the left has almost a complete monopoly of the media and to that I congratulate you. But I don't think this majority of media should be used to label half of our population as racists/sexist/bigots. Just because people do not agree with Obama does not mean they are racist. Just because people support the deportation of all immigrants whom are here illegally does not mean they are racists or bigots. Just because Christians think about abortions (I should mention I am actually pro-choice) are murder does not mean they hate women. And finally, just because some Democrats support Bernie Sanders does not make them communists. Can we all join together as Americans now and stand up to both sides of the media and loudly proclaim ""No I will not succumb to these tactics, I will not participate in mudslinging fellow Americans. I will not rush to judgement on quotes taken out of context and I will not automatically assume someone is racist/sexist/bigot just because they disagree with me""?
I believe that most Americans believe that the success of the civil rights movement and 19th amendment are just as responsible for making this country great as the very founding of our constitution. This is 2015, it is time for us to stop the animosity that so divides us from joining together as Americans. Because united is  undoubtedly the strongest form we have.

148,"What happened to Democratic Party in the South?Why is it that the South has gone from almost totally Democratic pre civil rights era to almost totally Republican now?

And Civil Rights may have something to do with it I don’t know if it was the massive decisive factor people say it was.

LBJ is quotes as saying “We’ve just lost the South for a generation” upon signing the Civil Rights Act. Well, he was incorrect.

It took the Democratic Party about a generation to lose the South.  I think Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton did quite well down there, and it wasn’t until 1994 that the majority of congressional seats from down there went to Republicans.

I suppose apart from Civil Rights you need to look at the two parties platforms and see which one lines up most with southern culture.

Which party is it that loves guns, loves Jesus, loves the death penalty, and doesn’t take kindly to foreigners? I guess that’s my answer "

528,"Something to think about ahead of the November electionsOn November 6, 2018, Americans will go to the polls to choose their representatives in government.  Many of those elections will be for national-level seats in the US House and US Senate.

Many voters will take advantage of early voting to avoid the crowds at the polls.

In the two or three weeks before election day, we will witness a time-honored American tradition: the October surprise.

Our various Intelligence Agencies have stated that the Russians are going to try to influence the 2018 election.  This shouldn't be a shock to us - they (and their predecessor, the Soviet Union) have been meddling in US politics for the better part of a century.

Its just a lot easier now between social media and the near-complete control by the left of broadcast media, and the President who told our cybersecurity folks to stand down when he was told in 2016 that the Russians were meddling in the election wasn't a Republican.

Fortunately we've been assured over and over again by our Intelligence Agencies that the Russians' efforts in 2016 failed, and that they weren't able to change any votes.  Their influence operations were largely conducted *after* the election, to sow dissent.

It is not in the Russians' interest for the US Congress to have a large Republican Majority, especially not if it is in both chambers.

As such, keep these things in mind when the inevitable October Surprises begin to roll in against Republican candidates:

1. The entire point of an October Surprise is to get you to react emotionally to information about which the whole story is not known.  The in-depth reporting that might exonerate a candidate (especially a Republican involved in an election) might not come out for weeks or months.  The MSM would rather report the politically-convenient lie than the politically-inconvenient truth.

2. It has been demonstrated that 40 year old accusations that can't be proven make effective ""October Surprise"" material, with willing and enthusiastic participation by the leftist press.  Expect more of this.  They know it works."

It seems to me there are a handful of Moderators out there banning Americans who are trying to stop mis-information... but yet they are allowing thousands of russian trolls to just bash away.. If this happened to me I can only imagine how bad this really is.

Note: they banned me for hate speech after providing actual facts that represent the racism ongoing inside of the republican party. I was attacked by russian trolls all night trying to spin it.. did everything I could for actual facts to be presented and allow the users to decide on their own. "

Looks like Frank White is the pro Trump Attorney General candidate over Ashley Moody as the establishment Republican.
Agriculture Commissioner Republican candidate Matt Caldwell has the NRA endorsement.
( Agriculture commission handles concealed carry permits in Florida)
What about the candidates for Judge?
It’s non partisan, so they can’t say which party they belong to. I would just vote for Republicans as I think they would generally be tougher on crime, more pro life and more gun friendly.
I have Group 13, 18 and 25 on my ballot. I have been to ALL their websites and they all have the same words about skills, justice and fairness.
Even the scientist candidate says she has skills, while her rival is a public defender. 
It’s like it is secret information whether they even belong to a political party. 
I’ve searched the net and there is no one issuing recommendations for judge candidates. I see Tea party recommendations for Texas, but none in Florida.
Anyone have any ideas on who rates these people? Any way to find out if they are Republicans?

667,45th president
894,"Can someone explain what Sanders as president would mean for me?I'm 16 years old and I've been trying to get a gauge for this whole politics thing because I'll be eligible to vote in 2016. The two candidates that have caught my eye are Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders.

With Rand Paul I understand that he plans on cutting Federal Income Tax down to 15% for everyone. Which would mean less of my money would go to government etc.

With Bernie I understand that he will try to take money from the rich and give to the poor; like a robin hood character.

What I'm wondering is would I be one of those receiving aid or one of those whom he plans to take wealth from. (I don't plan on being a billionaire; I'm essentially just an average middle class student who plans on staying in the middle class).

I plan on majoring in finance when I go to university and I'm also wondering if Sanders attack on banks would hurt a finance major because I'd assume banks would be less enticed to hire entry-level financial analyst with less capital.
