580,"What's going on with the property tax? Is it a community tax or an investment tax?The property tax is a community tax. The community pays tax on property into school budgets and City Council general funds. Property tax is a community tax.

If property can/is an investment. And increased property values is the purpose. The property tax can be used as an investment tax, not a community tax.

If Citizen A lives in an apartment an his neighborhood's property tax increased 25% in 4 years. Citizen A's purchasing power has decreased.

If Citizen B buys and remodels a home next to an apartment complex. Over 4 years his property taxes have increased 25%. Citizen B's home value has increased 65%. Citizen B has increased their portfolio.

If Citizen B sells stock and puts it in their savings account. Citizen B is assessed stock sale/investment tax at year end.

If Citizen A takes $200 from pay check and deposits it in savings while standing at the window next to citizen B. Citizen A is not assessed stock sale tax.

If property is an investment and property is not an investment. And the City Council/County Government can raise property values as part of their duties. City can have a happy, wealthy, person and a larger budget if they raise property values. Then property is not a proper investment. It is fraudulent.

Then, the County/City can raise property values to help reassess their citizens portfolio. Which also helps their budget. Property is an investment. Property is a portfolio.

The City/County raise property values to help/reassess their citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A community renter can not afford to stay, and moves. Which helps the citizen's portfolio. Which helps the city's budget.

The City/County raise property values to help/reassess their citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A community renter can not afford to stay, and moves. Which helps the citizen's portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A 30 year homeowner is on a fixed income and can not afford to stay. Homeowner sells house. House is turned into high end duplex. Which helps the citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget.

The City/County raise property values to help/reassess their citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A community renter can not afford to stay, and moves. Which helps the citizen's portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A 30 year homeowner is on a fixed income and can not afford to stay. Homeowner sells house. House is turned into high end duplex. Which helps the citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. 20 renters and 9 homeowners can't afford to stay and movie. Properties are town down and luxury apartments are build. Which helps the citizen's portfolio. Which helps the city's budget.

Property is an investment. Property is not an investment. Property tax pays for school and budget and city general fund. Property tax is a community tax, so what happened to the community?

Citizen A has a well funded investment account. Politician A can raise/lower dollar amount on Citizen A's investment account. Politician A tells citizen A that he can raise investment account 15% every year. Which will help his budget. If Citizen A agrees, Politician A will lower % from 4% to 3.5% in 2 years, 3.5% to 3% in 4 years, 3% to 2.5% in 6 years, and 2.5% to 2% in 8 years.

That's fraud.

If property is an investment.

City/county benefit from return on investment

If property is a portfolio

City/County do assess worth of portfolio

If property value reflects on City/County budget

City/Count will increase portfolio's value

If property value is increased by high value structure

City/County duty is to approve structures. Structures will always be approved

If property is an investment. But, the property tax is a community tax. Then City/County are required to exercise prudence. IF the property tax has been used to enrich investors and defraud the community. The city/county have acted illegally.

If property is an investment and the city/county have improperly applied a community tax as an investment tax. Exponentially rising costs will eventually remove the community. If, the city/county duty's include ‚Äì property value assessment ‚Äì and approval of new construction. And their community is only investors. Then it is not a community, it is a portfolio. And if the community is a portfolio. Then the City/County are not a government, they are investment managers. If investment community can force/coerce/vote added value to their portfolio. It is a criminal operation.

If Sky-scrappers and mega-structures add value. And a large American city has had a demographic shift and growth over 12 years. And the City/County has been using the property tax as an investment tax. Cost of living will go through the roof. If the City/County requests state/federal aid or funding for section 8 housing to house what were formerly housed citizens. Then that is a racket.

If the City/county ‚Äì in the face of this ‚Äì approve a new high value structure to increase ROI for community investors. The city/county is openly acting against the non-investor. If this is to continue ‚Äì then the progressive/mega-city growth will continue ‚Äì as the community-as-an-investment's children will have to always move to settle.

If property is an investment and property is not an investment. And the investor has minimal effect in overall quality of life of the investor. But the investor can drastically effect the quality of life and world of the non-investor. And the investor has a choice of living arraignments and the non-investor does not. Then the community needs to be planned around the non-investor.

The property tax is not an investment tax. The property tax is a community tax. If property is taxed, not because it is property, but because of its physical location within a community. Then the overall reason for owning property, investment or non-investment, should not be taken into consideration when applying the tax. If it has? If two decades of defrauding the community to enrich investors ‚Äì causing untold damage to the American Public ‚Äì resulted in any personal wealth or kickbacks to the City/County then they need to be held accountable. If a government refuses to hold themselves accountable. Then surrounding communities, cities, and counties, effected need to sue to force a cessation of mega-projects until all infrastructure upgrades have been planned for and completed and all necessary arrangements for displaced members of the community have been met.

The obvious pick would be Elizabeth Warren, whom I'm sure was asked not to run to give Hillary a chance, but seriously - there are 160,000,000 women in this country.  Even if 0.01% of them were highly educated, experienced, qualified, honest, strong and decent people, that's still a good 16,000 women.

Later she changed the website.
https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/1033211604630994945


It does not stop there. She responded to it.


From Julia,
&gt; Hi Stephen. I do not personally manage my website. I explained in my statement yesterday that a staffer who wrote the language in one platform page (written in first-person) mistakenly said this. I asked that it be corrected as soon as I was alerted to it yesterday morning.

https://twitter.com/JuliaCarmel__/status/1033376472529031168



The problem is there is a video of her saying she is an immigrant.

More campaigning on your ""identity"" as an ""immigrant.""
""I immigrated to this country with my family when I was very little. In Colombia, my mom raised me as a single mother..."" 0:37 seconds in.

LBJ is quotes as saying ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve just lost the South for a generation‚Äù upon signing the Civil Rights Act. Well, he was incorrect.

It took the Democratic Party about a generation to lose the South.  I think Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton did quite well down there, and it wasn‚Äôt until 1994 that the majority of congressional seats from down there went to Republicans.

I suppose apart from Civil Rights you need to look at the two parties platforms and see which one lines up most with southern culture.

I've been looking for a possibility to debate someone from the left side of the isle on internet, mostly because I acknowledge my weak understanding of politics and desire to change the situation.
I found few people, and I pm them. Some of them were open to share their views but very soon shut themselves up after my contr-arguments.

Every time I write about politics somewhere I get downvoted very hard, presumably by bots, but also by lefties.
But they never want to have a civil debate - get very offensive sometimes.

If you recommend me to find one in real life, then - where? 

But I want to use reddit avatar for right now, just to get more experience and make sure I understand politics well enough to not be afraid to open my mouth in public.

Regarding legalization of marijuana, I haven‚Äôt heard much regarding republican views. To me, it sound like a win-win situation. State  makes money off its taxes, ilegal sell decreases, no more people who  are incarcerated for possession of it   have to spend unnecessary time in prison which means that tax payers‚Äô money can be redirected to amore useful causes. Plus is less deadly than alcohol and tabaco which are both legal. I want to see (glance) at what a general republican opinion looks like. Whether you support it or not or are undecided. 

Edit: for transparency‚Äôs sake, I am not here to argue.  As every human I have a personal biases, therefore I just here to listen."

I believe electoral reform is inevitable. If you help to educate the public, it will accelerate the process and the people will respect you for it. I have been talking with people on the streets and most people will support electoral reform: the issue is education.

Without your help, it will be much slower going. But the process has already begun, and continues to gain momentum. Thanks for reading."

Many voters will take advantage of early voting to avoid the crowds at the polls.

In the two or three weeks before election day, we will witness a time-honored American tradition: the October surprise.

Our various Intelligence Agencies have stated that the Russians are going to try to influence the 2018 election.  This shouldn't be a shock to us - they (and their predecessor, the Soviet Union) have been meddling in US politics for the better part of a century.

Its just a lot easier now between social media and the near-complete control by the left of broadcast media, and the President who told our cybersecurity folks to stand down when he was told in 2016 that the Russians were meddling in the election wasn't a Republican.

Fortunately we've been assured over and over again by our Intelligence Agencies that the Russians' efforts in 2016 failed, and that they weren't able to change any votes.  Their influence operations were largely conducted *after* the election, to sow dissent.

It is not in the Russians' interest for the US Congress to have a large Republican Majority, especially not if it is in both chambers.

As such, keep these things in mind when the inevitable October Surprises begin to roll in against Republican candidates:

1. The entire point of an October Surprise is to get you to react emotionally to information about which the whole story is not known.  The in-depth reporting that might exonerate a candidate (especially a Republican involved in an election) might not come out for weeks or months.  The MSM would rather report the politically-convenient lie than the politically-inconvenient truth.

2. It has been demonstrated that 40 year old accusations that can't be proven make effective ""October Surprise"" material, with willing and enthusiastic participation by the leftist press.  Expect more of this.  They know it works."

Might I interest you in Reddit‚Äôs own Model US Government? In /r/ModelUSGov, we have an active Federal government with a House of Representatives, Senate, President, Supreme Court, as well as an active state government encompassing six states (all six are made up of the US's real states) each with a governor, assembly, and court system. In Model US Gov we have many members who propose bills, debate, run for office, and interact with a large community of individuals.

We would like you, a member of a movement dedicated to fighting far-right extremism, bigotry, racism, and hatred to help us do the same within our small community. The Democrats have uniquely passed legislation in order to better the lives of Americans by passing a $15 Minimum Wage, Universal Healthcare, gun-control legislation, criminal justice reform and the elimination of private prisons, environmental legislation, and much more. However, there‚Äôs still more to do, and we need your help to prevent the growing alt-right and anarcho-capitlaists from overturning much of the progress we‚Äôve achieved. 

If you would like to join a great community, and participate in a fun and fairly accurate simulation of government politics, be sure to join us on this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/5ymhfb/join_a_party/) and ask to join the Democrats. 

Thanks, and we hope to see you there!"

My question...The emails that were leaked by Wikileaks, and hacked by the Russians. Democrats have gone out of their way to say that the Russians attempted to influence our election by the hacking of the DNC and Podesta. But they have never spoken to the veracity of the information that was leaked, detailing corruption and collusion throughout the DNC. Why is it more important to say that Russian interference was a bigger deal, than talking about and confronting the corruption that was highlighted in the emails? Does it not matter that the people running the party are doing everything they can to lie to their party members in order to keep power? Please I want to understand this."

&gt;I‚Äôve been so inspired by the #WalkAway campaign that I'm getting over my fear and adding my voice. It‚Äôs such a shame what‚Äôs happening to our country. I‚Äôve seen this quote in several places recently and it resonates with me enough to try and paraphrase it here: if your love for your country hinges on who is president, then you don‚Äôt love your country. I am so proud to be an American and have the right to sit here today and express these thoughts. I‚Äôve tried to voice my concerns but it feels like such an all or nothing argument coming from the left. To vocalize any kind of dissenting opinion that doesn't fall in lock/step with ‚Äúthe war for social justice‚Äù gets us labeled a nazi, bigot, or some other kind of racist‚Äî sometimes by our own families. So here's my contribution to this movement. From one lifelong Democrat, here to say No More. I‚Äôm nowhere near Conservative, nowhere near Republican, but I‚Äôm still breaking up with my party. No more rabid cognitive dissonance, no more exaltation of victimhood-- I‚Äôve chosen to #WalkAway. - Vanessa Berben

I have Group 13, 18 and 25 on my ballot. I have been to ALL their websites and they all have the same words about skills, justice and fairness.
Even the scientist candidate says she has skills, while her rival is a public defender. 
It‚Äôs like it is secret information whether they even belong to a political party. 
I‚Äôve searched the net and there is no one issuing recommendations for judge candidates. I see Tea party recommendations for Texas, but none in Florida.
Anyone have any ideas on who rates these people? Any way to find out if they are Republicans?

The Senate has unconstitutionally refused to work with him to appoint a new supreme court justice. Therefore he must take unilateral action. Its a long shot, but he does pay attention to the official White House petitions. Right now, its the only constructive thing I can think to do.

WE THE PEOPLE ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROPOSE A NEW ADMINISTRATION POLICY: 

That the President immediately appoint a supreme Court justice 

Article II section 2 of the U.S. constitution states that the President can appoint a supreme Court justice with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Senate has explicitly refused to do its constitutional duty. It has given up the opportunity to advise and consent despite being given every opportunity and more than a reasonable amount of time to do so. Therefore, the President must take action and appoint a supreme Court justice. As the Senate has ignored its duty, the President must move forward nonetheless or else allow a defacto usurpation of executive power and an undermining of our constitution. This is the proper response to the ongoing crises created by the Senate. The questions raised by this crisis will be settled by a decision from the full nine member supreme Court."""

621,"Support the Model Democrats against the GOP and Libertarians!Hello fellow Democrats Supporters,

Might I interest you in Reddit‚Äôs own Model US Government? In /r/ModelUSGov, we have an active Federal government with a House of Representatives, Senate, President, Supreme Court, as well as an active state government encompassing six states (all six are made up of the US's real states) each with a governor, assembly, and court system. In Model US Gov we have many members who propose bills, debate, run for office, and interact with a large community of individuals.

We are currently in the middle of a Federal Election, and the Democrats are facing a tough reelection from Republicans and Libertarians. The Republicans have fielded a presidential candidate who very much resembles Donald Trump in his rhetoric and policy stances. Candidate /u/Viktard has been shown to be vehemently against abortion, universal healthcare, and has been proven to be a puppet for the extremists in his own party. On top of their presidential candidate, the GOP have also provided the alt-right an avenue to take down our Democracy. This is the time for people like you to join in the fight against the right! The Democrats are currently working with the Socialists, who have supported very moderate Incumbent /u/Bigg-Boss for reelection to the Presidency.

If you would like to help our cause, here‚Äôs how, and it will only take a few seconds:

1. Follow this link: https://musgov.melect.net/login

2. Follow all the directions. If you are asked to chose which state in which to vote, you are free to chose any irl state. The Democrats are running in The West, The East, the Northeast, and Central States. The map can be found [here](http://i.imgur.com/hnvHrVc.png) of where the irl states are corresponding to our in-sim states.  


3. Vote for the /u/Bigg-Boss(Socialist)/ /u/Aoimushi (Green-Left) presidential ticket, and vote for Democrats down the ballot (if no democrats are in the state you pick, choose our allies the Socialists or Green-Leftists).

Thank you for your help, and may Democracy stand strong against those who seek to destroy it.
