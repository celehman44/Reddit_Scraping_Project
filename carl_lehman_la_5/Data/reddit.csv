We will vote for DeSantis for Republican candidate for Governor because President Trump endorsed him over Putnam.
Did Trump endorse any other candidates on this ballot?
Looks like Frank White is the pro Trump Attorney General candidate over Ashley Moody as the establishment Republican.
Agriculture Commissioner Republican candidate Matt Caldwell has the NRA endorsement.
( Agriculture commission handles concealed carry permits in Florida)
What about the candidates for Judge?
It’s non partisan, so they can’t say which party they belong to. I would just vote for Republicans as I think they would generally be tougher on crime, more pro life and more gun friendly.
I have Group 13, 18 and 25 on my ballot. I have been to ALL their websites and they all have the same words about skills, justice and fairness.
Even the scientist candidate says she has skills, while her rival is a public defender. 
It’s like it is secret information whether they even belong to a political party. 
I’ve searched the net and there is no one issuing recommendations for judge candidates. I see Tea party recommendations for Texas, but none in Florida.
Anyone have any ideas on who rates these people? Any way to find out if they are Republicans?

&gt;I’ve been so inspired by the #WalkAway campaign that I'm getting over my fear and adding my voice. It’s such a shame what’s happening to our country. I’ve seen this quote in several places recently and it resonates with me enough to try and paraphrase it here: if your love for your country hinges on who is president, then you don’t love your country. I am so proud to be an American and have the right to sit here today and express these thoughts. I’ve tried to voice my concerns but it feels like such an all or nothing argument coming from the left. To vocalize any kind of dissenting opinion that doesn't fall in lock/step with “the war for social justice” gets us labeled a nazi, bigot, or some other kind of racist— sometimes by our own families. So here's my contribution to this movement. From one lifelong Democrat, here to say No More. I’m nowhere near Conservative, nowhere near Republican, but I’m still breaking up with my party. No more rabid cognitive dissonance, no more exaltation of victimhood-- I’ve chosen to #WalkAway. - Vanessa Berben

528,t3_8z8s0t,"On November 6, 2018, Americans will go to the polls to choose their representatives in government.  Many of those elections will be for national-level seats in the US House and US Senate.

Many voters will take advantage of early voting to avoid the crowds at the polls.

In the two or three weeks before election day, we will witness a time-honored American tradition: the October surprise.

Our various Intelligence Agencies have stated that the Russians are going to try to influence the 2018 election.  This shouldn't be a shock to us - they (and their predecessor, the Soviet Union) have been meddling in US politics for the better part of a century.

Its just a lot easier now between social media and the near-complete control by the left of broadcast media, and the President who told our cybersecurity folks to stand down when he was told in 2016 that the Russians were meddling in the election wasn't a Republican.

Fortunately we've been assured over and over again by our Intelligence Agencies that the Russians' efforts in 2016 failed, and that they weren't able to change any votes.  Their influence operations were largely conducted *after* the election, to sow dissent.

It is not in the Russians' interest for the US Congress to have a large Republican Majority, especially not if it is in both chambers.

As such, keep these things in mind when the inevitable October Surprises begin to roll in against Republican candidates:

1. The entire point of an October Surprise is to get you to react emotionally to information about which the whole story is not known.  The in-depth reporting that might exonerate a candidate (especially a Republican involved in an election) might not come out for weeks or months.  The MSM would rather report the politically-convenient lie than the politically-inconvenient truth.

2. It has been demonstrated that 40 year old accusations that can't be proven make effective ""October Surprise"" material, with willing and enthusiastic participation by the leftist press.  Expect more of this.  They know it works.",Something to think about ahead of the November elections,1,"Something to think about ahead of the November electionsOn November 6, 2018, Americans will go to the polls to choose their representatives in government.

867,t3_3ozdu3,"Hello everybody. Hope you all had a good Columbus Day weekend. I am starting a thread on this Reddit today to extend an olive branch across the aisle. I am a Republican. But I wholeheartedly respect the viewpoints of those on the left. To be honest, America would not be as great as it is without such a difference of opinion. Everyone thinking the same would be something more you would expect out of a country like North Korea. And so I welcome your differences in thought. First I will tell you what this thread is not. I have not come here looking to try to force Republican talking points upon independents/democrats. I have come here to remind everyone that we are all Americans who all live side by side in this great country. Some of my neighbors are Democrats, some of my Coworkers are Democrats even some of my immediate family are Democrats but most importantly they are all Americans.
I honestly believe that most Americans (Republicans and Democrats) are good people and want nothing but the best for all Americans with their policy ideals. And by good people I also mean that the vast majority of Americans are not racists, are not sexists, bigots, sociopaths. And that statement being true for the vast majority of Americans supersedes party lines. Yes, that even includes Republicans. At this time in history the left has almost a complete monopoly of the media and to that I congratulate you. But I don't think this majority of media should be used to label half of our population as racists/sexist/bigots. Just because people do not agree with Obama does not mean they are racist. Just because people support the deportation of all immigrants whom are here illegally does not mean they are racists or bigots. Just because Christians think about abortions (I should mention I am actually pro-choice) are murder does not mean they hate women. And finally, just because some Democrats support Bernie Sanders does not make them communists. Can we all join together as Americans now and stand up to both sides of the media and loudly proclaim ""No I will not succumb to these tactics, I will not participate in mudslinging fellow Americans. I will not rush to judgement on quotes taken out of context and I will not automatically assume someone is racist/sexist/bigot just because they disagree with me""?
I believe that most Americans believe that the success of the civil rights movement and 19th amendment are just as responsible for making this country great as the very founding of our constitution. This is 2015, it is time for us to stop the animosity that so divides us from joining together as Americans. Because united is  undoubtedly the strongest form we have.
",Hello fellow Americans,0,"Hello fellow AmericansHello everybody. Hope you all had a good Columbus Day weekend. I am starting a thread on this Reddit today to extend an olive branch across the aisle. I am a Republican. But I wholeheartedly respect the viewpoints of those on the left. To be honest, America would not be as great as it is without such a difference of opinion. Everyone thinking the same would be something more you would expect out of a country like North Korea. And so I welcome your differences in thought. First I will tell you what this thread is not. I have not come here looking to try to force Republican talking points upon independents/democrats. I have come here to remind everyone that we are all Americans who all live side by side in this great country. Some of my neighbors are Democrats, some of my Coworkers are Democrats even some of my immediate family are Democrats but most importantly they are all Americans.
I honestly believe that most Americans (Republicans and Democrats) are good people and want nothing but the best for all Americans with their policy ideals. And by good people I also mean that the vast majority of Americans are not racists, are not sexists, bigots, sociopaths. And that statement being true for the vast majority of Americans supersedes party lines. Yes, that even includes Republicans. At this time in history the left has almost a complete monopoly of the media and to that I congratulate you. But I don't think this majority of media should be used to label half of our population as racists/sexist/bigots. Just because people do not agree with Obama does not mean they are racist.

Might I interest you in Reddit’s own Model US Government? In /r/ModelUSGov, we have an active Federal government with a House of Representatives, Senate, President, Supreme Court, as well as an active state government encompassing six states (all six are made up of the US's real states) each with a governor, assembly, and court system. In Model US Gov we have many members who propose bills, debate, run for office, and interact with a large community of individuals.

We are currently in the middle of a Federal Election, and the Democrats are facing a tough reelection from Republicans and Libertarians. The Republicans have fielded a presidential candidate who very much resembles Donald Trump in his rhetoric and policy stances. Candidate /u/Viktard has been shown to be vehemently against abortion, universal healthcare, and has been proven to be a puppet for the extremists in his own party. On top of their presidential candidate, the GOP have also provided the alt-right an avenue to take down our Democracy. This is the time for people like you to join in the fight against the right! The Democrats are currently working with the Socialists, who have supported very moderate Incumbent /u/Bigg-Boss for reelection to the Presidency.

If you would like to help our cause, here’s how, and it will only take a few seconds:

1. Follow this link: https://musgov.melect.net/login

2. Follow all the directions. If you are asked to chose which state in which to vote, you are free to chose any irl state. The Democrats are running in The West, The East, the Northeast, and Central States. The map can be found [here](http://i.imgur.com/hnvHrVc.png) of where the irl states are corresponding to our in-sim states.  


3. Vote for the /u/Bigg-Boss(Socialist)/ /u/Aoimushi (Green-Left) presidential ticket, and vote for Democrats down the ballot (if no democrats are in the state you pick, choose our allies the Socialists or Green-Leftists).

Thank you for your help, and may Democracy stand strong against those who seek to destroy it.

The Senate has unconstitutionally refused to work with him to appoint a new supreme court justice. Therefore he must take unilateral action. Its a long shot, but he does pay attention to the official White House petitions. Right now, its the only constructive thing I can think to do. 

You can sign the petition at:

 https://petitions.whitehouse.gov//petition/president-immediately-appoint-supreme-court-justice

 or 

https://wh.gov/ieWHl 

Full text below: 

WE THE PEOPLE ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROPOSE A NEW ADMINISTRATION POLICY: 

That the President immediately appoint a supreme Court justice 

Article II section 2 of the U.S. constitution states that the President can appoint a supreme Court justice with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Senate has explicitly refused to do its constitutional duty. It has given up the opportunity to advise and consent despite being given every opportunity and more than a reasonable amount of time to do so. Therefore, the President must take action and appoint a supreme Court justice. As the Senate has ignored its duty, the President must move forward nonetheless or else allow a defacto usurpation of executive power and an undermining of our constitution. This is the proper response to the ongoing crises created by the Senate. The questions raised by this crisis will be settled by a decision from the full nine member supreme Court.""",The President needs to appoint a supreme court justice now,0,"The President needs to appoint a supreme court justice nowPresident Obama has told us to push him to do what we want him to do. What he needs to do now is to secure the only branch of government not yet in the hands of the republicans - the judicial branch. 

The Senate has unconstitutionally refused to work with him to appoint a new supreme court justice. Therefore he must take unilateral action. Its a long shot, but he does pay attention to the official White House petitions. Right now, its the only constructive thing I can think to do. 

You can sign the petition at:

 https://petitions.whitehouse.gov//petition/president-immediately-appoint-supreme-court-justice

 or 

https://wh.gov/ieWHl 

Full text below: 

WE THE PEOPLE ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROPOSE A NEW ADMINISTRATION POLICY: 

That the President immediately appoint a supreme Court justice 

Article II section 2 of the U.S. constitution states that the President can appoint a supreme Court justice with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Senate has explicitly refused to do its constitutional duty. It has given up the opportunity to advise and consent despite being given every opportunity and more than a reasonable amount of time to do so. Therefore, the President must take action and appoint a supreme Court justice. As the Senate has ignored its duty, the President must move forward nonetheless or else allow a defacto usurpation of executive power and an undermining of our constitution. This is the proper response to the ongoing crises created by the Senate. The questions raised by this crisis will be settled by a decision from the full nine member supreme Court."""

I am the Labour Party prospective candidate for the Thames Valley in the Model House of Commons.

/r/MHOC is a Model House of Commons based in reddit. It's election time, and the model Labour Party desperately needs your votes!

You can vote here, it only takes a minute:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOC/comments/46xtgq/general_election_v_megathread/

You vote using the New Reddit Based System, which means you are no longer required to comment to verify your vote. It uses D'Hondt, so you need only cast one vote for Labour in your chosen constituency! We're standing everywhere, but we've also got Labour-Cooperative candidates in the Hampshire, Greater Manchester, English Borders, Wales and Birmingham.

Not only is it important for the game that we have a strong Labour party (so we can escape the harsh realities of the Tory government in real life!), but it would mean a lot to all of us involved as we've put a lot of work into this campaign and the subreddit. We're a mix of people from across Labour's internal political spectrum, many of whom are members in real life, and our brief manifesto can be found here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOCPress/comments/46wuu2/gev_labour_party_manifesto/

It only takes a minute, but, as I said, it would mean a great amount to us and we would all be eternally grateful. If you want to join the model party, please do - you'll find a link in the /r/MHOC sidebar - and we'll very happily welcome you to our subreddit (/r/MHOCLabour). 

Cheers!

In Model US Gov we have many members who propose bills, debate, run for office, and interact with a large community of individuals.

We would like you, a member of a movement dedicated to fighting far-right extremism, bigotry, racism, and hatred to help us do the same within our small community. The Democrats have uniquely passed legislation in order to better the lives of Americans by passing a $15 Minimum Wage, Universal Healthcare, gun-control legislation, criminal justice reform and the elimination of private prisons, environmental legislation, and much more. However, there’s still more to do, and we need your help to prevent the growing alt-right and anarcho-capitlaists from overturning much of the progress we’ve achieved.

The following is just some reflections I have been working on from the Devils advocate position of the Iraq war being necessary.
I know youll hate me for it, but Im curious as to your opinion


It is almost common consensus that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a mistake at best, and at worst, the worst foreign policy decision in recent years. However, coming to either conclusion one would have to overlook facts and circumstances that led up to the invasion itself. The undisputed facts about Saddam Hussein and the time period between the two gulf wars would indicate that a second war with Iraq was only a matter of time. The current situation with North Korea and the Trump administration helps illustrate the potential danger of letting rogue states slowly grow in power and influence. Saddam’s regime was in some ways more dangerous and unpredictable than North Koreas. By the time of the Iraq invasion, it had started a brutal war with Iran, used chemical weapons on its own people, invaded and occupied Kuwait and launched missiles into Saudi Arabia and Israel. During the 1990s, Iraq was constantly visited by United Nations Weapons Inspectors, seeking to investigate and stop Iraq’s suspected development of Weapons of Mass destruction activity.  Iraq ceased cooperation with the inspectors in 1998, and UN inspections would not resume until 2002.

President Bill Clinton acknowledged the threat Iraq posed,  when he signed into law the Iraq National Liberation act of 1998. With nearly universal support of the U.S Congress the Act made leant official US support to helping democratic opposition groups replace Saddam’s government, citing Saddam’s potential Weapons of mass Destruction capabilities as  as only one of many justifications for the act which included:

1.	The Iraq instigated 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war, which resulted in nearly 2 million casualties, including chemical attacks on the Kurds, an ethnic group native to Northern Iraq
2.	Iraq’s violation of terms of the 1991 Gulf War Ceasefire, (which  included moving troops to the border of Kuwait in 1994 and attempting to invade and control the autonomous Kurdish region in the North)
3.	The attempted assassination by car bomb of  the Emir of Kuwait and former President George H.W Bush in 1993. 

All of these undisputed facts led to a bi partisan consensus that Saddam’s regime was a potential security threat that had to be addressed. 

Although the Saddam Hussein regime had no role 9/11 attacks and was not officially allied with Al-Qaeda it was a supporter of terrorism in the region and around the world, and paid host to several terrorists including.

1.	Abu Nidal, Palestinian terrorist (top of FBI’s most wanted  list before Osama Bin Laden.

2.	Muhammad Abbas (of the 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking)

3.	Abdul Rahman Yasin who mixed chemicals for first 1993 WTC attacks.

4.	In addition to inviduals Saddam helped finance the 2000-2001 Palestinian Intifadah against Israel, awarding cash rewards  (of up to x amount of dollars)  to the families of the deceased. 


In conclusion, Saddam Hussein’s regime was uniquely brutal and troublesome on a level unmatched by most of the United States adversaries, including Iran. With it’s history of terrorism, WMD development, and unprovoked war,…..(will finish conclusion.)

I’m /u/randomKdebater, a member of the Democratic party on /r/ModelUSGov. I’m here today to convince you to join the Model Democratic party, institute the laws you have always wanted to see be instituted, debate, and connect with a great community. 

The Model Democrats have already made some great legislative progress, such as repealing the Taft-Hartley Act, increasing the minimum wage to $15, creating a negative income tax, increasing funding for education and infrastructure. The Democrats have also spearheaded almost all environmental and green legislation, championed issues of women’s rights, minorities, legalized gay marriage, and have stood for net neutrality. However, this isn’t enough, because there is still so much left to do. 

The Model Democrats are also a great space; everyone is incredibly friendly, and excited to help out new members get accustomed to the simulation. In the community, you can debate and express your opinion, receive help from more experienced members, and try your hand at creating pieces of legislation. The Democrats also have fun weekly movie nights, questions of the week, and so much more!

Midterm elections are coming up, and the Republican party has been on the rise, doing very well in state elections and turning more and more into its real life counterpart. Not to mention, the rise of a new Nationalist/Fascist party only reinforces that these types of laws are not safe from being overturned without your help.

Whatever Party you do decide to join, we'd be glad to have you in the sim, and I hope you have a great time there as well. We would be incredibly grateful to have you join our sub and have a fantastic, and very realistic experience of government in one of the best communities on the sim!

Not everything mirrors real-life *exactly*, for example, we're a much broader leftist party (soc-dem to Clintonian liberals) than the actual Democratic Party, but for the most part, it's a good bit of fun.

We currently need members to fill our ranks and to run for office in the upcoming general election.  We need Senate and House candidates, bad.
